/**
 * try.ts - Standalone test script for the Report-to-Quest pipeline
 *
 * This file is a development sandbox used to test and prototype the Gemini AI
 * integration before porting the logic into route.ts. It runs independently
 * via `npx tsx src/app/api/reports/try.ts` from the project root.
 *
 * What it does:
 *   1. Fetches all quests from Supabase via Prisma
 *   2. Sends a hardcoded report to Gemini with quest context
 *   3. Validates Gemini's JSON response with a Zod discriminated union schema
 *   4. Either creates a new quest or increments Weight on a matched quest
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - Uses relative imports (not @/ alias) because tsx doesn't resolve tsconfig paths
 *   - Requires `dotenv/config` to load .env (must run from a directory containing .env)
 *   - Uses gemini-2.5-flash-lite model (lighter, less rate-limited than flash)
 *   - This file is NOT an API route — it's a test script meant to be run manually
